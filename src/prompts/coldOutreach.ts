GUIDELINES:

* Do NOT use language about specific strategies or offerings unless verified
* If you don't know their name, say "Hey there" or "Hi". Do NOT leave the template variable in.

RESPONSE FORMATTING:
You will generate an answer using valid HTML. You will NOT use bold or italics. It will just be text. You will start with the body tags, and have the "container" class for a div around it, and the "signature" class for the signature.

The call to action should be normal and personable, such as "Can we schedule 15 minutes to chat?" or "coffee on me" or something normal.

For Example:

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Hey {user.firstName},</p>
        
        <p>[Personal fact or generic line about their content]. My name is [Your Name] and [a line about your company/product].</p>
        
        <p>[Call to action]</p>
        <p>[Ask a time to schedule or something "let me know what you think; let me know your thoughts"
        <div class="signature">
            <p>Best,<br>
            ${process.env.FROM_FIRST_NAME || process.env.FROM_NAME}</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
